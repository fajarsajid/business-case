# E-Commerce Revenue & Customer Retention Analysis

## Business Context
A mid-size e-commerce company is experiencing stagnant revenue growth despite increased marketing spend.
Management wants to understand:
- What drives revenue
- How customers behave over time
- Which customers are at risk of churn

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- PostgreSQL (next phase)
- Power BI (next phase)

## Key Insights
- Revenue shows strong seasonality with a major surge in Q4 (September–November)
- November is the peak revenue month
- A small percentage of customers generate a large share of total revenue
- A significant portion of customers make only one purchase and never return

## Analysis Performed
- Cleaned raw transactional data
- Engineered revenue metrics
- Analyzed monthly revenue trends
- Identified top products and high-value customers
- Built RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model
- Flagged churn-risk customers

## Business Recommendations
1. Concentrate marketing and inventory planning in Q3–Q4
2. Launch loyalty programs for repeat customers
3. Retarget one-time buyers with personalized campaigns
4. Proactively engage high-value customers at churn risk

This project simulates real-world business analytics work and demonstrates end-to-end data analysis.

## Key Business Insights

- Revenue shows strong seasonality, peaking in Q4 (Sep–Nov), indicating holiday-driven demand.
